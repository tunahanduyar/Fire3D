Create a 3D cylinder of the appropriate level for your character, make it as small as possible and set the transparency settings to zero. Define the code to a button, now every click on this button will cause the physics engine cylinders to advance and lower your enemy's health level (wasted bullets will disappear after a while)

It makes a sound every time the button is clicked, you can also use the animation of changing bullets and adding new bullets, and you can show all actions on your canvas screen with the text content you create. Simple and fast.
