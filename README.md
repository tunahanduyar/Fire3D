Create a 3D cylinder at the appropriate level for your character, make your cylinder as small as possible and set the transparency settings to zero. Define the code to a button, now every time this button is clicked, the cylinders will move forward thanks to the physics engine, lowering your enemy's health level (wasted bullets will disappear after a while)

It makes a sound every time the button is clicked, you can also use the animation of changing bullet and adding new bullet, and you can show all the actions on your canvas screen with the text content you create. Simple and fast.
